# Customer Command Center Dashboard – NHT/Cesanek

**Facility**: NHT/Cesanek (LT_F21) | **Tenant**: LT | **Timezone**: America/New_York

Deployed at: [customer-command-center-dashboard-5fcabc.coolify.item.pub/dashboard](https://customer-command-center-dashboard-5fcabc.coolify.item.pub/dashboard)

## Overview

Real-time operational dashboard for monitoring ticket queues, customer health, and action priorities at the NHT/Cesanek facility.

## Ticket Filtering Rules

| Rule | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| **Include Statuses** | New, Open, Pending |
| **Exclude Statuses** | Reopen, Reopened, Closed, Resolved, Cancelled, Done |
| **Exclude Invoice Items** | billing, UF Billing, storage, handling |
| **UFN Filtering** | Enabled – UFN-tagged tickets surfaced in all views |
| **Deduplication** | Overlapping ticket/email threads merged |
| **Outlook Context** | Non-blocking enrichment where available |
| **Authority** | TicketOps status is authoritative |
| **Eligibility Gate** | `displayStatusSystemStatus = open` **AND** `displayStatusName ∈ {New, Pending}` |
| **closeFlag Gate** | **NOT USED** – closeFlag is not a filter; live `closeFlag=true` tickets are retained (auto-close artifacts cause false negatives) |

## Customer Health

Coverage rule: All customers visible in eligible NHT/Cesanek tickets. Configured roster/aliases are supplemental only.

## Dashboard Sections

1. **Counts** – Total eligible, by status, UFN-tagged, excluded
2. **Priority Queue** – Sorted by priority & age
3. **Action Buckets** – Immediate (<24h), Short-Term (1–3d), Medium (3–7d), Watch (>7d)
4. **Customer Health** – Per-customer ticket counts, aging, UFN exposure, health ratings
5. **Evidence & Metrics** – Outlook matches, dedup stats, invoice exclusions, SLA risk, freshness

## Current Dashboard State (Last Refresh: Sep 19 2026 23:05 ET – AUTHORITATIVE)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Raw (systemStatus=open) | 344 = New 236 + Pending 66 + Reopen 38 + billing-topic 1 + General Inquiry topic 3 |
| Gate matched | 302 (New 236, Pending 66) |
| Eligible | **275** (217 New, 0 Open, 58 Pending) |
| UFN-Count | 275 |
| Excluded | 22 billing/UF Billing/storage/handling + 5 overlapping-thread duplicates; Reopen 38 outside gate |
| closeFlag | **NOT a gate** — 24 live `closeFlag=true` tickets retained |
| Customers | **46** distinct orgs (all customers visible in eligible tickets; roster supplemental) |
| SLA Risk | **HIGH** – 232 SLA-breached / 43 on-track; 226 unassigned; 172 aged 15+ days |
| Outlook Coverage | **Unavailable this cycle** (Outlook agent returned no content, 2 attempts) – non-blocking, so ticket data stays authoritative; 0 direct matches reported rather than stale threads |
| Last Refresh | 2026-09-19 23:05 ET (**AUTHORITATIVE** – fresh TicketOps pull, 344 open rows enumerated in department, topic scope "UF General Inquiry") |
| Next Refresh | ~08:00 ET (daily summary email) |

> **Premise correction (this refresh):** the instruction cited UFN-67030 as "live-Pending with closeFlag=true". Ticket Ops is authoritative and shows UFN-67030 = `displayStatusName=Solved`, `displayStatusSystemStatus=20`, `closeFlag=true`, staff-closed 2026-09-01. It is excluded **by status**, not by closeFlag. The rule stands: `closeFlag` is not an eligibility gate (24 live `closeFlag=true` rows are retained in this refresh).
>
> **Billing-rule flag:** Ticket Ops' own signals (topic `UTCS: Accessorial charges`, the `Billable items` form field, and the separate `Unis Fulfillment Billing` department) identify only one true invoice item at this facility (**UFN-33719**), which sits outside the gate. The 22 rows excluded here are removed by the dashboard's established `excludeInvoiceItems` subject/type rule and are mostly facility billing statements ("Cesanek – Final invoice", "Cesanek – Billing 9/01-9/15", "Storage <month>", "Handling <period>"). Owner to confirm whether the rule should be narrowed to true invoice items.

## 🚨 Data Freshness Notice

**This refresh (Aug 11 05:07 ET) is an AUTHORITATIVE refresh** with a fresh TicketOps LIVE connection. All statuses verified directly against TicketOps. 39 tickets that were previously assumed eligible (based on Aug 10 23:20 ET preserved state) were found to have moved to ineligible statuses (Closed/Resolved/Cancelled) in TicketOps.

**Queue health**: 81% reduction from stale state. Only 9 verified eligible tickets remain. SLA breach rate is now 22% (2/9), which is significantly elevated due to the smaller denominator.
